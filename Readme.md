`loon` is a toolkit for interactive data visualization and
exploration. Currently, `loon` is embedded in `R` and `Tcl`.

To get more on either system, go look at the `README` in the corresponding directory above, `R` or `Tcl`.

We also have two documentation websites

* `Tcl` and `R` documentation [here](http://great-northern-diver.github.io/loon/l_help)
* `R` only manual style documentation [here](http://great-northern-diver.github.io/loon/)


`loon` is joint work of [Adrian Waddell](http://adrian.waddell.ch) and
[R.W. Oldford](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/).


## On the name

The software is named after a large aquatic bird known as the [**common loon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_loon) in Canada and the United States, or the **great northern diver** in the United Kingdom.  (Hence the name of the github organization: [https://github.com/great-northern-diver](https://github.com/great-northern-diver)) 

The loon is a visual predator, diving deep beneath the surface, there chasing its prey with speed and remarkable maneuvrability. Once apprehended, the prey
are either swallowed immediately or, when large, at least brought to the surface to be dealt with there. 

This seemed an excellent metaphor for an agile, interactive, and exploratory visualization system; one which empowered an analyst to chase, and perhaps discover, whatever features might be revealed in the data by quickly diving below its surface.  The goal is to provide such a system in loon.

As an acronym "loon" does not fare so well (**l**east **o**bvious **o**stensive **n**ame) and perhaps its synonym "diver" would be better  (**d**irect **i**nteractive **v**isual **e**xploration in **R**).  But, then,  "loon" is funnier ...  **diveR** is the name of a collection of "loon" related packages.

Enjoy!
