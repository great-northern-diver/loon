`loon` is a toolkit for interactive data visualization and
exploration. Currently, `loon` is embedded in `R` and `Tcl`.

`R` users should use `loon` within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
or with the Terminal.

Please see the [web documentation](http://waddella.github.io/loon/)
for more information and installation instructions.

`loon` is joint work of [Adrian Waddell](http://adrian.waddell.ch) and
[R.W. Oldford](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/).
