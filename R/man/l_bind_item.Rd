\description{
Canvas bindings are triggered by a mouse/keyboard gesture over
  the plot as a whole.
}
\details{
Item bindings are used for evaluating callbacks at certain mouse and/or
keyboard gestures events (i.e. X events) on visual items on the canvas. Items
on the canvas can have tags and item bindings are specified to be evaluated
at certain X events for items with specific tags.

Note that item bindings get currently evaluated in the order that they are
added.

Bindings, callbacks, and binding substitutions are described in detail in
loon's documentation webpage, i.e. run \code{l_help("learn_R_bind")}
