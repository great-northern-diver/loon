\title{The \code{\link{l_plot}} method for classical seasonal decomposition of a time series by moving averages (i.e. via \code{decompose()})}
\usage{
\method{l_plot}{decomposed.ts}(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  xlabel = NULL,
  ylabel = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  tk_title = NULL,
  color = l_getOption("color"),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{decomposed.ts} object}

\item{y}{\code{NULL}, ignored}

\item{xlabel}{the labels for the x axes.  This is a length four character vector one for each: of the original
time series, the trend component, the seasonality component, and the remainder. If of length 1, the label is repeated; if \code{NULL}, \code{xlabel} is "time".}

\item{ylabel}{the labels for the vertical axes.  This is a length four character vector one for each: of the original
time series, the trend component, the seasonality component, and the remainder. If \code{NULL}, the default,
\code{ylabel} will be \code{c("data", "trend", "seasonality", "remainder")}; if a character vector of length 1, the label is repeated four times.}

\item{title}{an overall title for the entire display. If \code{NULL} (the default), the title will be "Seasonal Trend Analysis".}

\item{tk_title}{provides an alternative window name to Tk's \code{wm title}.  If \code{NULL}, \code{stl} will be used.}

\item{color}{points colour of all time series.
Default given by \code{\link{l_getOption}("color")}.}

\item{size}{points size of all time series.
Default given by \code{\link{l_getOption}("size")}.}

\item{lcolor}{line colour of all time series.
Default given by \code{\link{l_getOption}("color")}.}

\item{linewidth}{line width of all time series (incl. original and decomposed components.
Default given by \code{\link{l_getOption}("linewidth")}.}

\item{linkingGroup}{name of linking group.
If missing, one is created from the data name and class associated with \code{stlOrDecomposedTS}.}

\item{showScales}{a logical as to whether to display the scales on all axes, default is TRUE.}

\item{showGuides}{a logical as to whether to display background guide lines on all plots, default is TRUE.}

\item{showLabels}{a logical as to whether to display axes labels on all plots, default is TRUE.}

\item{call}{a call in which all of the specified arguments are specified by their full names}

\item{...}{keyword value pairs passed off to \code{\link{l_plot}()} which constructs each loon scatterplot component.}
}
\value{
A structure of class \code{"l_ts"} containing four loon plots each representing a part of the decomposition
by name: "original", "trend", "seasonal", and "remainder".
}
\description{
Creates a decomposed time series plot based on
objects of class \code{decomposed.ts}
}
\examples{
if(interactive()){

decompose <- decompose(co2)
p <- l_plot(decompose, title = "Atmospheric carbon dioxide over Mauna Loa")
# names of plots in the display
names(p)
# names of states associated with the seasonality plot
names(p$seasonal)
# which can be set
