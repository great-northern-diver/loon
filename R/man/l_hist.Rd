\arguments{
\item{x}{vector with numerical data to perform the binning on x,}

\item{yshows}{one of "frequency" (default) or  "density"}

\item{by}{loon plot can be separated by some variables into mutiple panels.
This argument can take a \code{vector}, a \code{list} of same lengths or a \code{data.frame} as input.}

\item{layout}{layouts in a \code{'grid'} or a \code{'wrap'}}

\item{connectedScales}{Determines how the scales of the facets are to be connected depending
on which \code{layout} is used.  For each value of \code{layout}, the scales are connected
as follows:
\itemize{
\item{\code{layout = "wrap":}  Across all facets, when \code{connectedScales} is
   \itemize{
   \item{\code{"x"} or \code{"column"} (not suggested), then  only the "x"  scales are connected}
   \item{\code{"y"} or \code{"row"} (not suggested), then only the "y" scales are connected}
   \item{\code{"both"} or \code{"cross"} (not suggested),  both "x" and "y" scales are connected}
   \item{\code{"none"},  neither "x" nor "y" scales are connected.}
   }
   }
\item{\code{layout = "grid":}  Across all facets, when \code{connectedScales} is
   \itemize{
   \item{\code{"cross"}, then only the scales in the same row and the same column are connected}
   \item{\code{"row"}, then both "x" and "y" scales of facets in the same row are connected}
   \item{\code{"column"}, then both "x" and "y" scales of facets in the same column are connected}
   \item{\code{"x"}, then all of the "x"  scales are connected (regardless of column)}
   \item{\code{"y"}, then all of the "y" scales are connected (regardless of row)}
   \item{\code{"both"},  both "x" and "y" scales are connected in all facets}
   \item{\code{"none"},  neither "x" nor "y" scales are connected in any facets.}
   }
   }
 }}

\item{showStackedColors}{if TRUE (default) then bars will be coloured according to
colours of the points; if FALSE, then the bars will be a uniform colour
except for highlighted points.}

\item{origin}{numeric scalar to define the binning origin}

\item{binwidth}{a numeric scalar to specify the binwidth
If NULL \code{binwidth} is set using David Scott's rule when \code{x} is numeric
(namely 3.49 * sd(x)/(n ^(1/3)) if sd(x) > 0 and 1 if sd(x) == 0)
and using the minumum numerical difference between factor levels when \code{x}
is a factor or a character vector (coerced to factor).}

\item{showBinHandle}{If \code{TRUE}, then an interactive "bin handle" appears on the plot
whose movement resets the \code{origin} and the \code{binwidth}.  Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{color}{colour fills of bins (default "grey60"); colours are repeated
until matching the number x.}

\item{active}{a logical determining whether x appears or not
(default is \code{TRUE} for all x). If a logical vector is given of length
equal to the number of x, then it identifies which x appears (\code{TRUE})
and which does not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{selected}{a logical determining whether x appears selected at first
(default is \code{FALSE} for all x). If a logical vector is given of length
equal to the number of x, then it identifies which x is (\code{TRUE})
and which is not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{xlabel}{label to be used on the horizontal axis. If NULL, an attempt at a meaningful label
inferred from \code{x} will be made.}

\item{parent}{parent widget path}

\item{...}{named arguments to modify the histogram plot states or layouts, see details.}
}

\description{
\code{l_hist} is a generic function for creating an interactive histogram display that can be linked with
  loon's other displays
}
\details{
\itemize{
  \item {
  Note that when changing the \code{yshows} state form
  \code{'frequency'} to \code{'density'} you might have to use
  \code{\link{l_scaleto_world}} to show the complete histogram in the plotting
  region.
  }
  \item {Some arguments to modify layouts can be passed through,
  e.g. "separate", "byrow", etc.
  Check \code{\link{l_facet}} to see how these arguments work.
