\title{Return a list of the available image formats when exporting a loon plot}
\usage{
l_export_valid_formats()
}
\value{
a vector with the image formats available for exporting a loon plot.
}
\description{
The supported image formats are dependent on the system
  environment. Plots can always be exported to the Postscript format.
  Exporting displays as .pdfs is only possible when the command line tool
  epstopdf is installed. Finally, exporting to either png, jpg, bmp, tiff or
  gif requires the Img Tcl extension. When choosing one of the formats that
  depend on the Img extension, it is possible to export any Tk widget as an
  image including inspectors.
