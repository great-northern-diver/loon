\title{Create an interactive loon 3d plot widget}
\usage{
l_plot3D(x, y, z, axisScaleFactor, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the x, y and z arguments provide the x, y and z coordinates for the plot.
         Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable.
         See the function xyz.coords for details.

         If supplied separately, they must be of the same length.}

\item{y}{the y coordinates of points in the plot,
optional if x is an appropriate structure.}

\item{z}{the z coordinates of points in the plot,
optional if x is an appropriate structure.}

\item{axisScaleFactor}{the amount to scale the axes at the centre of the rotation.
Default is 1.
    All numerical values are acceptable (0 removes the axes, < 0 reverses their direction.)}

\item{...}{named arguments to modify plot states.}
}

  \if{html}{ The general direct manipulation and interaction gestures are
  outlined in the following figures.

  Rotating

  Press 'R' to toggle rotation mode.
  When rotation mode is active, either use the below mouse gestures or arrow keys to rotate the plot.

  \figure{gestures_rotate.png}{options: alt="Rotate gestures"}

  The centre of the rotation can be changed by panning the plot.
  To reset the rotation, use the tripod icon in the plot inspector.

  Zooming and Panning

  \figure{gestures_zoom_pan.png}{options: alt="Zoom pan gestures"}

  Selecting Points/Objects

  Moving Points on the Scatterplot Display

  }

  NOTE: Although it is possible to programmatically add layers to an l_plot3D, these will not
  appear as part of the 3D plot's display. There is no provision at present to incorporate
  rotation of 3D geometric objects other than point glyphs.
