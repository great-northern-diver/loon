\title{l_plot method for seasonally decomposed by loess time series objects (i.e. via stl)}
\usage{
\method{l_plot}{stl}(x, y = NULL, pcolor = NULL, size = 1,
  lcolor = NULL, linewidth = 1, xlabels = NULL, ylabels = NULL,
  title = NULL, tk_title = NULL, linkingGroup = NULL, showScales = TRUE,
  showGuides = TRUE, showLabels = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{stl} object}

\item{y}{NULL, ignored}

\item{pcolor}{points colour of all time series. If NULL (the default) \code{lcolor} will be \code{l_getOption("foreground")}.}

\item{size}{points size of all time series. Default value is 1.}

\item{lcolor}{line colour of all time series. If NULL (the default) \code{lcolor} will be \code{l_getOption("foreground")}.}

\item{linewidth}{line width of all time series (incl. original and decomposed components. Default is 1.}

\item{xlabels}{the labels for the x axes: a length four character vector for each of the original 
time series, trend, seasonality and remainder. If \code{NULL}, xlabels is created as "time".}

\item{ylabels}{the labels for the vertical axes: a length four character vector for each of the original 
time series, trend, seasonality and remainder. If \code{NULL}, ylabels is created based on the information provided.}

\item{title}{an overall title for the entire display. If \code{NULL} (the default), the title will be "Seasonal Trend Analysis".}

\item{tk_title}{provides an alternative window name to Tk's \code{wm title}.  If \code{NULL}, \code{stl} will be used.}

\item{linkingGroup}{name of linking group.
If NULL, one is created from the data name and class associated with \code{stlOrDecomposedTS}.}

\item{showScales}{a logical as to whether to display the scales on all axes, default is TRUE.}

\item{showGuides}{a logical as to whether to display background guide lines on all plots, default is TRUE.}

\item{showLabels}{a logical as to whether to display axes labels on all plots, default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{keyword value pairs passed off to \code{l_plot()} which constructs each loon scatterplot component.}
}
\value{
A structure of class \code{"l_ts"} containing four loon plots each representing a part of the decomposition
by name: "original", "trend", "seasonal", and "remainder".
}
\description{
a generic function for creating a decomposed time series plot based on 
objects of class \code{stl}
}
\examples{
co2_stl <- stl(co2, "per")
p <- l_plot(co2_stl, title = "Atmospheric carbon dioxide over Mauna Loa")
# names of plots in the display
names(p)
# names of states associated with the seasonality plot
names(p$seasonal)
# which can be set
p$seasonal['color'] <- "steelblue"
}
