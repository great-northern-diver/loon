\usage{
l_bind_item_reorder(widget, ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{widget}{widget path as a string or as an object handle}

\item{ids}{new item binding id evaluation order, this must be a 
rearrangement of the elements returned by the
\code{\link{l_bind_item_ids}} function.}
}
\value{
vector with binding id evaluation order (same as the \code{id} argument)
}

The order the item bindings defines how they get evaluated 
  once an event matches event patterns of multiple item bindings.

Reordering item bindings has currently no effect. Item bindings 
  are evaluated in the order in which they have been added.
