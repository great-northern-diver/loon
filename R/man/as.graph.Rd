\value{
graph object of class loongraph

\description{
Loon's native graph class is fairly basic. The graph package (on
  bioconductor) provides a more powerful alternative to create and work with 
  graphs. Also, many other graph theoretic algorithms such as the complement 
  function and some graph layout and visualization methods are implemented 
  for the graph objects in the RBGL and Rgraphviz R packages. For more 
  information on packages that are useful to work with graphs see the
  \emph{gRaphical Models in R} CRAN Task View at
  \url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=gR}.
