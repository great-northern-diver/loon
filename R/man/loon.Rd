\title{loon: A Toolkit for Interactive Data Visualization and Exploration}
\description{
Loon is a toolkit for highly interactive data visualization. Interactions 
with plots are provided with mouse and keyboard gestures as well as via 
command line control and with inspectors that provide graphical user 
interfaces (GUIs) for modifying and overseeing plots.
}
\details{
Currently, loon implements the following statistical graphs: histogram, 
scatterplot, serialaxes plot (star glyphs, parallel coordinates) and a graph 
display for creating navigation graphs.

Some of the implemented scatterplot features, for example, are zooming, 
panning, selection and moving of points, dynamic linking of plots, layering 
of visual information such as maps and regression lines, custom point glyphs 
(images, text, star glyphs), and event bindings. Event bindings provide hooks
to evaluate custom code at specific plot state changes or mouse and keyboard 
interactions. Hence, event bindings can be used to add to or modify the 
default behavior of the plot widgets.

Loon's capabilities are very useful for statistical analysis tasks such as 
interactive exploratory data analysis, sensitivity analysis, animation, 
teaching, and creating new graphical user interfaces.

To get started using loon read the package vigniettes or visit the loon
