#' @title Fatty Acid Composition of Italian Olive Oils
#'
#' @description This data set records the percentage composition of 8 fatty
#'   acids found in the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive
#'   oils. The oils are samples taken from three Italian regions varying number
#'   of areas within each region.  The regions and their areas are recorded as
#'   shown in the following table:
#'
#'   \tabular{ll}{ \bold{Region} \tab \bold{Area}\cr North \tab North-Apulia,
#'   South-Apulia, Calabria, Sicily \cr South \tab East-Liguria, West-Liguria,
#'   Umbria \cr Sardinia \tab Coastal-Sardinia, Inland-Sardinia }
#'
#' @format A data frame containing 572 cases and 10 variates.
#' \describe{
#'  \item{Region}{Italian olive oil general growing region: North, South, or Sardinia}
#'  \item{Area}{These are "Administrative Regions" of Italy (e.g. Sicily, or Umbria), or parts of such a region like
#'  "Coastal-Sardinia" and "Inland-Sardinia" or "North-Apulia" and "South-Apulia". Administrative regions are larger
#'  than, and contain, Italian provinces.}
#'  \item{palmitic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Palmitic acid, or hexadecanoic acid in the olive oil.
#'  It is the most common saturated fatty acid found in animals, plants and micro-organisms.}
#'  \item{palmitoleic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Palmitoleic acid, an omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid.}
#'  \item{stearic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid. It is a waxy solid and
#'  its name comes from the Greek word for tallow. Like palmitic acid, it is
#'  one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature.}
#'  \item{oleic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Oleic acid, the most common fatty acid occurring in nature found in
#'  various animal and vegetable fats and oils.}
#'  \item{linoleic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid.
#'  It is one of two essential fatty acids for humans.}
#'  \item{linolenic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Linolenic acid, a type of fatty acid. It can refer to one
#'  of two types of fatty acids or a mixture of both.  One is an omega-3 essential fatty acid; the other an omega-6.}
#'  \item{arachidic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Arachidic acid, also known as eicosanoic acid, a saturated fatty acid
#'  that is used for the production of detergents, photographic materials and lubricants.}
#'  \item{eicosenoic}{Percentage (in hundredths of a percent) of Eicosenoic acid, which may refer to one of three closely related
#'  fatty acids: gadoleic acid (omega-11), gondoic acid (omega-9), or paullinic acid (omega-7). }
#' }
#' Note that the percentages (in hundredths of a percent) should sum to approximately 10,000 for each oil (row).
