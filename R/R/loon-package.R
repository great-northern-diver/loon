#' loon: A Toolkit for Interactive Data Visualization and Exploration
#'
#' Loon is a toolkit for highly interactive data visualization. Interactions
#' with plots are provided with mouse and keyboard gestures as well as via
#' command line control and with inspectors that provide graphical user
#' interfaces (GUIs) for modifying and overseeing plots.
#'
#' Currently, loon implements the following statistical graphs: histogram,
#' scatterplot, serialaxes plot (star glyphs, parallel coordinates) and a graph
#' display for creating navigation graphs.
#'
#' Some of the implemented scatterplot features, for example, are zooming,
#' panning, selection and moving of points, dynamic linking of plots, layering
#' of visual information such as maps and regression lines, custom point glyphs
#' (images, text, star glyphs), and event bindings. Event bindings provide hooks
#' to evaluate custom code at specific plot state changes or mouse and keyboard
#' interactions. Hence, event bindings can be used to add to or modify the
#' default behavior of the plot widgets.
#'
#' Loon's capabilities are very useful for statistical analysis tasks such as
#' interactive exploratory data analysis, sensitivity analysis, animation,
#' teaching, and creating new graphical user interfaces.
