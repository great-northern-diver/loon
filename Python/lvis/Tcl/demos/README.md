# Running the demos

In order to run the `loon` demos the `tcl` interpreter needs to find
the `loon` package. See the `README.md` in the parent directory.

Start `tkcon` and check if the `loon` package loads

~~~
package require loon
~~~

then start a demo (e.g. `power.tcl`) with

~~~
source power.tcl
~~~
