* Note that currently the `data` argument does not refer to a state
  and, therefore, cannot be changed after creation.
* The scatterplot matrix is currently a compound widget. A single
  widget implementation is planned.

# Scatterplot Matrix

<R>

Note that in the above example `ps` is a list with the individual
scatterplot handles. Use

~~~
names(ps)
~~~

to figure out which plot handle is associated with which handle.

To reset the zoom and pan for each display to show all points you
could use `l_scaleto_plot` or `l_scaleto_world` for each plot on the
diagonal. However it is easier to just evaluate the function on all
plot handles:

~~~
sapply(ps, l_scaleto_plot)
~~~

</R>
